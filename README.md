arachat 3 is the next generation client for wrongthink, intended to supersede the old wrongthink. planned features include:

* multiple connections
* hosting servers within the client
* file uploading in accordance with the wrongthink standard
* potentially calls
* stricter html sanitization
* TURN servers

this is the absolute bleeding edge of wrongthink. the old client will no longer be maintained to make time for the development of this new one.
